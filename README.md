# Analysis-of-Argumentative-Political-Texts-Using-LLMs

## Models
1. Random Forest Model as Baseline
2. Closed source LLMs 
   - grok-4
   - grok-3-mini (partially in the Prototype Application)
   - gpt-5-2025-08-07 (partially in the Prototype Application)
   - gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07 (partially in the Prototype Application)
   - gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07 (removed, controlling for TPM limit add unnecessary complexity)
3. Open source LLMs 
   - Apertus-70B (only in Jupyter Notebook)
   - Apertus-8B (only in Jupyter Notebook)

## Prototype Application with GUI
Run `prototype/app.py` and open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in browser. Multilanguage and one LLM is implemented. For demonstration and performance purposes, all necessary metadata is stored in `prototype/static/votes.json`. If you want to run the app from scratch you need to create a `.env` file in `prototype/agents/` and add your own API keys.

political parties are represented in Switzerland best known debating shown. The same dataset, contained of transcribed 
and annotated subtitles of the debates could be used for argumentation mining and later be assessed for the degree of
